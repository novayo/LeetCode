* Runtime: 64 ms, faster than 91.67% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters.
* Memory Usage: 12.7 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters.

> hash_table + sliding window
	> store index in hash_table, we only care about the smallest index of item
	> So, when we have to update something, find out the smallest index and update i to that index + 1
